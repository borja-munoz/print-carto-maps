# Print CARTO Maps

Web maps normally don't print well, as their resolution is much lower than
normal print resolution. With Print CARTO Maps you can get
high resolution maps for printing by leveraging 
[Maplibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) along with 
[deck.gl](https://deck.gl) to render maps created with 
[CARTO Builder](https://carto.com/builder/).

## Options

* Inches or millimeters
* PNG or PDF output (PDF is Letter size for inches, A4 for millimeters)
* Choice of map styles
* Height and width settings
* DPI setting

## Usage

1. Create your map with CARTO Builder
2. Share the map publicly and copy the Map ID
3. Enter the Map ID in the corresponding text box and click on the "Load" button
4. Choose the desired options
5. Click on the "Generate Map" button

## Limitations

- The application only works with maps shared publicly
- The application does not support Google Maps basemap. If the map uses one of those, it will switch to a default CARTO basemap.

## Building

Run a local webserver such as `python3 -m http.server`, and open `index.html`.

## Deployment

```shell
$ cp index.html build
$ cp -r css build
$ cp -r js build
$ firebase deploy
```
